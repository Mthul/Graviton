    <h2>About the game</h2>
    <p>Voyage is a top down, sci-fi rogue-like shooter developed for a project course at KTH. <br/> 
    Our vision for the game was a corgi in a space suit traveling to different worlds based on <br/> 
    mythology, fiction and history, to defeat enemies and gain power and resources. <br>
    It the game's current state, there is only one playable level, one based on Ancient egyptian mythology,<br/>
    but there are many more planned for the future if we do choose continue development. <br/> 
    We hope you enjoy what we've made so far! </p>
